# Omni_drive_robot
This repo consists of four wheeled robot model in the robotics simulation software called Coppeliasim and the C/C++ code written to interface visual code with Coppeliasim using external_api. Here a different set of modules is created to perform the task of reading the sensor data, applying different algorithms and lastly giving the actuating commands to different motors to perform the tasks of navigation in the predefined environment.You can also use A* algorithms defined in the github repo of this [link](https://github.com/love481/A_Star-Algorithm).


## Installation

In order to run the simulation,You will have to install coppeliasim education version and visual studio.
